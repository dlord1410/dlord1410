## Hello There! üëã

üíª My name is DJ. I am an aspiring entrepreneur with a passion for computer science and business. I'm a full-time college student who lives in the United States. I am actively pursuing my Associate of Arts and Associate of Science degree with the intent to transfer to receive a Bachelors degree in both Computer Science and Business.

üß† I have always been experimenting with computers and programming since an early age. However, it was not until recently that I was given a formal introduction to coding. I was first introduced to HTML and CSS through a dual enrollment course, and later taught JavaScript from my local high school. In the last few months, I have also started to learn Java.

üå± I continue to investigate other languages. My current focus is expanding my knowledge on Java, with the intention to further my understanding of other programming languages in the near future.

üõ†Ô∏è I have been recognized as someone who is very detail-oriented, ensuring that everything lines up. I like to look things over and break larger projects into pieces, allowing me to digest the content in sections. For problem-solving, I tend to find myself working on finding a temporary solution, then trying to find the most efficient solution possible to ensure there is nothing being wasted.
